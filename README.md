# IPL-Data-Analysis
#  IPL Data Analysis Project

##  Overview
This project analyzes **Indian Premier League (IPL)** data to uncover interesting patterns, trends, and insights about players, teams, and match outcomes.  
It uses **Python** for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy for data analysis  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook  

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Top run scorers and wicket takers across seasons  
- Most successful IPL teams by season  
- Impact of toss on winning probability  
- Venue-specific winning trends  
- Player performance analysis (e.g., Orange Cap, Purple Cap trends)  

## Sample Insights
- Teams winning the toss do **not always** have a higher chance of winning.  
- Certain venues strongly favor specific teams.  
- Consistent top performers (like Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Rohit Sharma) have major impact on match outcomes.  

##  Future Work
- Build a **match outcome prediction model** using ML.  
- Deploy the project as a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive analysis.  

##  Repository Contents
- `ipl2022.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation
